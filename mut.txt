- In reverse, for (int i = 0; i < to <= n / 2; i++) mutation survives as swapping a letter with itself won't make difference in reverse
- In reverse, while (l < n) survived as it won't do anything when l == n


- In atoi, if (len >= to < 12) is just for saving processing early, answer would be same even if len > 12 is written
- Survival of 
        if (conv < Integer.MIN_VALUE)
        {
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }

        if (conv > Integer.MAX_VALUE)
        {
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
  is understandable


- firstoccurence, for (int i = ns +- 1; i < comb.length(); i++) survived as needle can't be in itself
